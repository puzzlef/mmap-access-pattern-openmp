Design a fast parallel memory access pattern for a memory-mapped file with `mmap()`.

```bash
$ ./main.sh
# OMP_NUM_THREADS=64
# Finding byte sum of file /home/graphwork/Data/indochina-2004.mtx ...
# {adv=0, block=4096, mode=0} -> {0000532.8ms, sum=148985827434} byteSum
#
# OMP_NUM_THREADS=64
# Finding byte sum of file /home/graphwork/Data/uk-2002.mtx ...
# {adv=0, block=4096, mode=0} -> {0000880.9ms, sum=244964049087} byteSum
#
# ...

I tried a simple file bytes sum using `mmap()` - both sequential and parallel using openmp (64 threads on DGX). I adjust `madvise()`, `mmap()`, and per-thread block size to see which access pattern has the best performance. It seems to me using an early `madvice(MADV_WILLNEED)`, a per-thread block size of `256K` (`dynamic` schedule) is good. Below is a plot showing the time taken with this config for each graph.

In parallel doing a file byte sum takes `~100ms` on `indochina-2004` graph. Note that [PIGO] takes `~650ms` to load the same graphs as CSR. Next i measure the read bandwith of each file, simply by dividing the size of each file by the time taken.

We appear to be reaching a peak bandwidth of `~35GB/s`. The [KIOXIA KCM6DRUL7T68 7.68TB NVMe SSD] installed on DGX has a peack sequential read performance of `62GB/s` (we are close). Sequential approach can hit a max of only `6GB/s`.

There is a paper called "Efficient Memory Mapped File I/O for In-Memory File Systems" on the topic - where Choi et al. working at Samsung say that `mmap()` is a good interface for fast IO (in contrast to file streams) and propose async map-ahead based `madvise()` for low-latency NVM storage devices. The also have a good slides on this - where their (modified) extended madvice obtains `~2.5x` better performance than default `mmap()` by minimizing the number of page faults.
